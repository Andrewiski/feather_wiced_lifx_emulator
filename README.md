# feather_wiced_lifx_emulator
Adafruit Wiced Neopixel Lifx Emulator

This application can be tested using a Adafruit Wiced Feather and the Adafruit NeoPixel FeatherWing.

This Application uses the SPI flash to store Config information so requires the SPI shunt be sholdered closed on the Wiced Feather.

Work In Progress.
